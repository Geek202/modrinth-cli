## Cache
Downloaded mod JARs are also cached in `~/.modrinth-cli/cache` to save bandwidth if you include the same mod in several installations.
This cache will be redesigned to use hashes rather than just file names and also be organised better.

## Additional files
### modrinth-mods.toml
This file is used to store the list of mods you have, along with the loader and game version.
#### Commented example:
```toml
[mods]
  # The key is the slug of the mod on Modrinth, and the value is the version ID
	lambdabettergrass = "JiU63vNt"
	ok-zoomer = "kvcXLIhw"
	fabric-api = "LCbP8k6I"
	modmenu = "6YvLIUDN"
	phonos = "LeV8Qms9"
	inspecio = "5nUnR4gM"

# Settings here will be used for resolving the latest compatible version of mods.
[details]
  # This can be 'fabric' or 'forge', as these are the platforms that Modrinth supports
	loader = "fabric"
	gameVersion = "21w06a"
```
### mods/.installed-mods
This is a JSON file that should NOT be modified by hand, and is used to keep track of what mod JARs are for which mod.
#### Example: (for the mods listed above)
```json
{
  "mods": [
    {
      "modSlug": "fabric-api",
      "modId": "P7dR8mSH",
      "versionId": "LCbP8k6I",
      "filename": "fabric-api-0.30.2+1.17.jar"
    },
    {
      "modSlug": "modmenu",
      "modId": "mOgUt4GM",
      "versionId": "6YvLIUDN",
      "filename": "modmenu-2.0.0-beta.2.jar"
    },
    {
      "modSlug": "inspecio",

      "versionId": "5nUnR4gM",
